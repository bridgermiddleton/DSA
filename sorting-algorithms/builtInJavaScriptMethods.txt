JavaScript .sort()

- sorts by the Unicode of each element in the array
- converts the element into its respective unicode and then sorts via this
- really only works with strings and still sometimes doesn't works
- however, this function accepts an optional parameter called a "comparator" function that tells JS how we want it to sort
- let's say we put in a pair of numbers (a and b), JS determines the sort based on their return value
    - if it returns a negative number, a should come before b
    - if it returns a positive number, b should come before a
    - if it returns 0, they are viewed as the same (e.g. a === b)


example functionality:

function numberCompare(a, b) {
    return num1 - num2
}

[5, 2, 3, 1].sort(numberCompare) -> [1, 2, 3, 5]
