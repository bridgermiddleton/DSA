Data Structures

    What Do They Do?
        Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied
        to the data

    Why So Many?
        Different data structures excel at different things.  Some are highly specialized, while otheres (like arrays)
        are more generally used.

    Why Care?
        The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures

    Which Is Best?
        There is no best.  They all excel in different situations.

        Working with map/location data (e.g. Google Maps), use a graph!

        Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end, use a linked list!




    ES2015 Class Syntax Overview

        What is a class?
            A blueprint for creating objects with pre-defined properties and methods
            JS doesn't really have them...

        We're going to implement data structures as classes


        The Syntax

            class Student {
                constructor(firstName, lastName) {
                    this.firstName = firstName;
                    this.lastName = lastName;
                }
            }


            - the method to create new objects must be called constructor
            - the class keyword creates a constant, so you can not redefine it.  Watch out for
              the syntax as well!

        Creating Objects from classes

            - we use the "new" keyword


            let firstStudent = new Student("Colt", "Steele");
            let secondStudent = new Student("Deez", "Nutz");
            
            - "this" refers to the individual instance of the class (e.g. firstStudent, secondStudent)

        Instance Methods

            class Student {
                constructor(firstName, lastName) {
                    this.firstName = firstName;
                    this.lastName = lastName;
                }
                //Instance method example
                fullName(){
                    return `Your full name is ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
                }
            }

            let firstStudent = new Student("Colt", "Steele");

            firstStudent.fullName();

            - method specific to the class
            - e.g. an array's push() or pop() methods

        Class Methods

            - static key word in front of a method definition
            - not that common
            - often used to create utility functions for an entire class
            - not related to a single instance, rather the entire class


            class Student {
                constructor(firstName, lastName) {
                    this.firstName = firstName;
                    this.lastName = lastName;
                }
                //Instance method example
                fullName(){
                    return `Your full name is ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
                }

                static enrollStudents(...students) {
                    //maybe send an email here
                }
            }

            let firstStudent = new Student("Colt", "Steele");
            let secondStudent = new Student("Deez", "Nutz");
            Student.enrollStudents([firstStudent, secondStudent]);


            - better example is the Point class example, where you use a class method to calculate
              the distance between two points.  It's a utility function for the class essentially.
