Comparisons with arrays
    Lists
        - do not have indexes!
        - connected via nodes with a next pointer
        - random access is not allowed
        - if you really care about insertion and deletion, you might
          want to use a linked list

    Arrays
        - indexed in order!
        - insertion and deletion can be expensive
        - can quickly be accessed at a specific index
